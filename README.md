# wabtec_RailWheelFlatDetection
Automatic Wheel Flat Detection Using CNN

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and advanced image processing techniques to detect wheel flats on railway wheels in static images. The model identifies the presence of wheel flats, estimates their severity based on bounding box size, and maps each detected wheel to its respective axle and carriage. The system is designed to work with a set of static images of railway wheels and generates detailed outputs such as bounding box coordinates, detected wheel flat dimensions, depth proxy estimates, and axle-carriage mappings.
